## Overview

The Payroll Management System SQL Project is a database management system designed to efficiently handle payroll-related data for an organization. This project utilizes SQL (Structured Query Language) to create and manage the database, making it easy to store, retrieve, and manipulate employee payroll information.

## Features

- Employee Information Management
- Salary Calculation
- Tax Deductions
- Payroll Reports Generation
- Access Control for Admin and Employee Roles

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/payroll-management-sql.git
   ```

2. Set up the SQL database. Use your preferred SQL database management tool to create a new database and import the provided SQL script (`payroll_database.sql`) to create the necessary tables and schema.

3. Configure the database connection in your application code. You may need to update the database connection settings in the project's configuration file to match your database credentials.

4. Run the application and start managing employee payroll data.

## Usage

1. **Admin Dashboard**: After installation, access the admin dashboard to add employees, define salary structures, and generate payroll reports.

2. **Employee Portal**: Employees can log in to view their salary details, pay slips, and tax information.

3. **Payroll Generation**: Use the system to calculate salaries, including tax deductions, for each employee based on predefined salary structures.

4. **Reporting**: Generate various reports such as salary reports, tax reports, and employee attendance reports.
